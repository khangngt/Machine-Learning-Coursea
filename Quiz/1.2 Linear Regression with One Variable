Consider the problem of predicting how well a student does in her second year of college/university, given how well she did in her first year.

Specifically, let x be equal to the number of "A" grades (including A-. A and A+ grades) that a student receives in their first year of college (freshmen year). We would like to predict the value of y, which we define as the number of "A" grades they get in their second year (sophomore year).

Here each row is one training example. Recall that in linear regression, our hypothesis is hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x, and we use m to denote the number of training examples.


For the training set given above (note that this training set may also be referenced in other questions in this quiz), what is the value of m? In the box below, please enter your answer (which should be a number between 0 and 10).

Question 2

Many substances that can burn (such as gasoline and alcohol) have a chemical structure based on carbon atoms; for this reason they are called hydrocarbons. A chemist wants to understand how the number of carbon atoms in a molecule affects how much energy is released when that molecule combusts (meaning that it is burned). The chemist obtains the dataset below. In the column on the right, “kJ/mol” is the unit measuring the amount of energy released.


You would like to use linear regression (hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x) to estimate the amount of energy released (y) as a function of the number of carbon atoms (x). Which of the following do you think will be the values you obtain for θ0 and θ1? You should be able to select the right answer without actually implementing linear regression.

θ0=−569.6,θ1=−530.9

θ0=−569.6,θ1=530.9

θ0=−1780.0,θ1=530.9

θ0=−1780.0,θ1=−530.9

In the given figure, the cost function J(θ0,θ1) has been plotted against θ0 and θ1, as shown in 'Plot 2'. The contour plot for the same cost function is given in 'Plot 1'. Based on the figure, choose the correct options (check all that apply).



If we start from point B, gradient descent with a well-chosen learning rate will eventually help us reach at or near point A, as the value of cost function J(θ0,θ1) is maximum at point A.

Point P (The global minimum of plot 2) corresponds to point C of Plot 1.

If we start from point B, gradient descent with a well-chosen learning rate will eventually help us reach at or near point C, as the value of cost function J(θ0,θ1) is minimum at point C.

If we start from point B, gradient descent with a well-chosen learning rate will eventually help us reach at or near point A, as the value of cost function J(θ0,θ1) is minimum at A.

Point P (the global minimum of plot 2) corresponds to point A of Plot 1.

Suppose that for some linear regression problem (say, predicting housing prices as in the lecture), we have some training set, and for our training set we managed to find some θ0, θ1 such that J(θ0,θ1)=0.

Which of the statements below must then be true? (Check all that apply.)


For these values of θ0 and θ1 that satisfy J(θ0,θ1)=0,

we have that hθ(x(i))=y(i) for every training example (x(i),y(i))

For this to be true, we must have θ0=0 and θ1=0
so that hθ(x)=0

This is not possible: By the definition of J(θ0,θ1), it is not possible for there to exist

θ0 and θ1 so that J(θ0,θ1)=0

We can perfectly predict the value of y even for new examples that we have not yet seen.

(e.g., we can perfectly predict prices of even new houses that we have not yet seen.)
